  /**
   * An objective property we override to tell it where to search for models for relationships
   *
   * When setting a relationship in a model we have to provide a reference to the related model. As we need to set the
   * relationship on both sides this leads to
   * {@link https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/relations.html#require-loops|require-loops}. We can avoid this
   * by having the model tell Objection where to search for models for relationships. In the relationship declaration we
   * can then just use a string value
   *
   * ```
   *  // ...
   *  relation: Model.ManyToManyRelation,
        modelClass: 'authorised_system.model',
      // ...
      ```

      We don't want to do this in every model so set it in the `BaseModel` as Objection recommends.
