  /**
   * When running in a production environment ('pre' or 'prd') filter the routes we register with Hapi.
   *
   * Initially conceived as a very simple 'feature toggle' solution. In the main our features are related to endpoints;
   * a new feature typically means a new endpoint. We want the ability to work on new features, but still push other
   * changes, for example, patches and fixes into production.
   *
   * So, we use this service to ensure any endpoint that is still being worked on is not available when the API is
   * running in production. We also include pre-production in our protected environments so we can test and ensure
   * an endpoint does not get registered as part of our release testing and sign-off.
   *
   * We identify routes to filter because they have a custom `excludeFromProd` property which has been added to the
   * {@link https://hapi.dev/api/?v=20.1.3#-routeoptionsapp|route options app property} the Hapi provided place apps
   * can store route configuration
   *
   * This service is used by the `RouterPlugin` to check which routes need filtering before it then registers them with
   * the Hapi server instance.
   *
   * @param {Object[]} routes An array of Hapi routes expected to be provided by the `RouterPlugin`
   * @param {string} environment The current environment ('dev', 'tst', 'tra', 'pre' or 'prd')
   *
   * @returns {Object[]} an array of Hapi routes, filtered depending on the current environment and whether any paths
   * have been registered as needing filtering
