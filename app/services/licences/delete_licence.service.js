   * Deletes a licence along with its transactions and updates the invoice and bill run accordingly. Intended to be run
   * as a background task by a controller, ie. called without an await. While the licence is being deleted, the bill
   * run's status will be set to `pending`, and restored to its original status afterwards. Note that the licence will
   * _not_ be validated to ensure it is linked to the bill run; it is expected that this will be done from the calling
   * controller so that it can present the appropriate error to the user immediately.
   *
   * The invoice will be updated by subtracting the licence's credit/debit line count/value etc. and updating the zero
   * value, deminimis and minimum charge invoice flags. Note that this will be done regardless of whether or not the
   * bill run has been generated.
   *
   * If the bill run has been generated then the credit note/invoice count and value fields will be updated.
   *
   * @param {module:LicenceModel} licence The licence to be deleted.
   * @param {module:BillRunModel} billRun The bill run the licence belongs to, which we use to determine its current
   * status.
   * @param {@module:RequestNotifierLib} notifier Instance of `RequestNotifierLib` class. We use it to log errors rather
   * than throwing them as this service is intended to run in the background.
