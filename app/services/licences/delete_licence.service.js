   * status will be set to `pending`, and restored to its original status afterwards. Note that the licence will _not_
   * be validated to ensure it is linked to the bill run; it is expected that this will be done from the calling
   * controller so that it can present the appropriate error to the user immediately.
   *
   * The invoice will be updated by subtracting the licence's credit/debit line count/value etc. and updating the zero
   * value, deminimis and minimum charge invoice flags. Note that this will be done regardless of whether or not the
   * bill run has been generated.
   *
   * @param {module:LicenceModel} licence The licence to be deleted.

   * status.
   * @param {@module:RequestNotifierLib} notifier Instance of `RequestNotifierLib` class. We use it to log errors rather
   * than throwing them as this service is intended to run in the background.
