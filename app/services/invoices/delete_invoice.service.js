   * from the calling controller so that it can present the appropriate error to the user immediately.
   *
   * @param {module:InvoiceModel} invoice The invoice to be deleted.
   * @param {module:BillRunModel} billRun The bill run that the invoice belongs to.
   * @param {@module:RequestNotifierLib} notifier Instance of `RequestNotifierLib` class. We use it to log errors rather
   * than throwing them as this service is intended to run in the background.
   * @param {string} [status] Status of the bill run. If this service is being called from within another service then
   * the status may have changed to `pending`, in which case we need to be given the status prior to this so we can
   * determine if the bill run has been generated. Will default to the bill run's current status if not specified.
   * @param {object} [existingTrx] Optional transaction instance; only needed if calling this service from within an
   * existing transaction.
